#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and tools in designing, developing and maintaining simple and user friendly softwares.
Importance of Software in technology industry include:
1. Automation of tasks- Some tasks that would need much work such as record management which would involve a lot of paper work could be automated using softwares like MS Excel
2. Time conservation- Some tasks which would require physical availability can be done remotely using softwares
3. Financial benefits- Software engineering is a well paying career and it is a source of income.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s - 1960s: Birth of Software Engineering. During this period, the concept of software engineering emerged in response to the growing complexity of software systems. ...
1970s - 1980s: Structured Programming and Methodologies. ...
1990s - Present: Agile and DevOps

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Ideation
2. Requirements- Defining the user needs and system requirements (functional and non-functional)
3. Design- Coming up with high-level and detailed design of teh software architecture
4. Implementation- Developing/coding the software components as per the defined plan
5. Testing- Running tests on developed system to see if it meets the requirements
6. Deployment- Releasing the product to the client/users for use
7. Maintenance- Continous enhancements and updates on the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential, in that it follows a specific pattern of implementation while agile is iterative and incremental focusing on producing a working prototype at the end of each milestone.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer- Does the coding and implementation of the design features of the software
2. Quality Assurance Engineer- Determines if the software meets that standards of the client, user friendly and ethical
3. Project Manager- Assigns tasks supervises progress and reports to the client and other managers

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide comprehensive tools such as debugging tools for software developement 
Version Control Systems are used to keep track of development progress of a project while enabling collaboration between developers
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Diversity- A lot of tech stack available for software development hence a hard choice to make on which one to focus on; an engineer should just make a decision on what to do and stick with that till he/she gets so good at it.
2. Drastic evolution of tech- Technology is changing drastically and it is quite hard to keep up; As a good engineer, it's a good practive to pay attention to changes and evolution in the tech space.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- focuses on  individual components, intergration testing focuses on module interaction, system testing on the entire system and acceptance is on the user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promp engineering is the art of giving clear instructions to a generative AI in order to get the best version of the required output

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Tell me about python programming language
Refined: Precisely inform me in the simplet way all there is to know about python as a programming language without being vagous

The refined promt is more effective since the output will be more summarized, straight to the point and shorter
